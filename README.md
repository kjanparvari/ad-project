# Social Structure Detection in Graphs  

This project aims to implement and analyze an algorithm for detecting social structures in graphs. It includes the implementation of specific graph data structures and sorting algorithms required for the analysis.  

## Features  
1. **Graph Representation**:  
   - Uses an adjacency list for efficient graph storage and traversal.  

2. **Sorting Algorithms**:  
   - Supports the following sorting algorithms for analysis:  
     a. Insertion Sort  
     b. Bubble Sort  
     c. Merge Sort  
     d. Quick Sort  

3. **Social Structure Detection**:  
   - Implements an algorithm to identify social structures within a graph.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python 

## Purpose  
This project demonstrates the implementation of graph-based algorithms and their integration with fundamental sorting techniques to analyze and detect social structures.
